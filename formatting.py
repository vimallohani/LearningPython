name="vimal Lohani"

print("Your name is :"+name+" and age is "+str(age)) #Bad formatting

#in python 3 we use place holder {} and format function, 
#no type casting is needed in format function
print("Your name is :{} and age is {}".format(name,age))

#in python 3.5 we use place holder and we also apply f before " in print function
print(f"Your name is :{name} and age is {age}")

#you can apply calculation inside placeholder
